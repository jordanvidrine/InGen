# InGen
A friend suggested to get deeper with my learning that I should attempt to build my own static site generator.

I started reading Jurrasic Park last night, and today I will start building this generator.

Here is my attempt.

### In Progress
- Dynamic saving of images used in markdown files and templates
- Creation of multiple .html files at once
- Implement dev server to dynamically watch file edits
- Separate getting page data from getting sections as they are independent of one another
